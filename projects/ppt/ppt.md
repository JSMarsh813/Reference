started off with a bang 🤣 did " npm run start" and was going what the hell why won't it show my edits unless I reboot it.

Realized I needed to do npm run dev 🤦‍♀️

was getting a "Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)" when importing a react component

Stared at my files for a second and realized I forgot to save the component's changes 🤡.

That immediate fix was instant serotonin!

I was trying to add links to the navbar in nextjs but I was getting this error:
"Error: Multiple children were passed to <Link> with `href` of..."

Found this tip about removing any space between <Link> and <a> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69667347/nextjs-multiple-children-were-passed-to-link-with-href-of-x-but-only-one/72754603

Fixed it! I would of NEVER of guessed 😂

Quotation from the stackOverflow Link: "Are you sure that's how its written in your source file? This error usually happens if you have a space in between <Link> and the <a> tags"

was trying to figure out why the test post request seemed to work, except the collection was blank!

Turns out the body was showing as "text" instead of "json!" Once I switched it to "json" in postman it worked

Couldn't resist trying to debug an axios error I kept getting: " OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite `test5` model once compiled"

Adding some code to the left of my exports helped it stop yelling about using the model again "mongoose.models['test5']" 🎊🎊

code snippet: "module.exports = mongoose.models['test5']|| mongoose.model("test5",CategoryCollectionSchema);

next step i suppose will be to store whats been clicked in a react state? and then send that to the server as a second get request. Oh boy, thats gonna take a while.

(an example: store christmas + male in state, and only get back animal names with both those tags)

Made some slow but definite progress!

I can generate a list from the server and also by clicking the checkbox i can store the selected results in an array in the state. And clicking even removes it from the array (after lots of struggle haha)!

Still trying to figure out how to make it so it'll let me narrow down/filter the search...
I want to start with all the names, and then have it look through the array of name objects (nameList here) and give me ones that have the given tags.

But thats for future me, Sleep time!

Though oddly it was chemistry of all things helped me! I had to think, what are the limiting factors and then write the code around the limiting factors

live pic of me fucking around and finding out with code before figuring things out. I'm a code arsonist today🔥🔥🔥

(right now I'm grabbing the names from a mock array in the document)

Or adding a form so users can submit new names

Ended up deciding to add a form to add new names 😄

I'm proud of my progress especially after working!

Users can select multiple tags (provided by a list from my server) and they can input a name. Both are saved in the state

Next step will be to have the button click = post request.

When setting up the post request I

1. Need to give them an error message if an existing name is there
2. have the objects from the state match the schema of the individualNames collection

its maddening since

1. new registrations show up in DB, errors properly show up if a user exists already in the database

2. if the incorrect login combo is given, they won't be redirected and the error messages work
   it's literally just the sessions!🙃😭

me @ the docs

also me explaining to my non-tech friends what a session is 😂

sessions are the powerhouse of the applications braincells! basically

"but uh, imagine a website is a doorman where you have to say the right password to get into the club

so you say "let me into the pokemon club", the correct password (usually this is your email and password). The doorman's braincells are a session, he goes ah! You said the right password i'll let you in.

if the doormans braincells are dead, then you can shout the password to him and he'll just blink blankly at you"

progress! If you're not signed in, the react-toastify alert will appear.

Buuut when you're signed in, if you click a heart icon, it will change them ALL red 🤔

which makes sense, as I told all the icons to get their color from "likesColor"
