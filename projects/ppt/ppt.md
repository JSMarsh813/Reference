started off with a bang 🤣 did " npm run start" and was going what the hell why won't it show my edits unless I reboot it.

Realized I needed to do npm run dev 🤦‍♀️

was getting a "Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)" when importing a react component

Stared at my files for a second and realized I forgot to save the component's changes 🤡.

That immediate fix was instant serotonin!

I was trying to add links to the navbar in nextjs but I was getting this error:
"Error: Multiple children were passed to <Link> with `href` of..."

Found this tip about removing any space between <Link> and <a> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69667347/nextjs-multiple-children-were-passed-to-link-with-href-of-x-but-only-one/72754603

Fixed it! I would of NEVER of guessed 😂

Quotation from the stackOverflow Link: "Are you sure that's how its written in your source file? This error usually happens if you have a space in between <Link> and the <a> tags"

Couldn't resist trying to debug an axios error I kept getting: " OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite `test5` model once compiled"

Adding some code to the left of my exports helped it stop yelling about using the model again "mongoose.models['test5']" 🎊🎊

code snippet: "module.exports = mongoose.models['test5']|| mongoose.model("test5",CategoryCollectionSchema);

next step i suppose will be to store whats been clicked in a react state? and then send that to the server as a second get request. Oh boy, thats gonna take a while.

(an example: store christmas + male in state, and only get back animal names with both those tags)

Made some slow but definite progress!

I can generate a list from the server and also by clicking the checkbox i can store the selected results in an array in the state. And clicking even removes it from the array (after lots of struggle haha)!

Still trying to figure out how to make it so it'll let me narrow down/filter the search...
I want to start with all the names, and then have it look through the array of name objects (nameList here) and give me ones that have the given tags.

But thats for future me, Sleep time!

Ended up deciding to add a form to add new names 😄

I'm proud of my progress especially after working!

Users can select multiple tags (provided by a list from my server) and they can input a name. Both are saved in the state

Next step will be to have the button click = post request.

When setting up the post request I

1. Need to give them an error message if an existing name is there
2. have the objects from the state match the schema of the individualNames collection

its maddening since

2. if the incorrect login combo is given, they won't be redirected and the error messages work

sessions are the powerhouse of the applications braincells! basically

"but uh, imagine a website is a doorman where you have to say the right password to get into the club

so you say "let me into the pokemon club", the correct password (usually this is your email and password). The doorman's braincells are a session, he goes ah! You said the right password i'll let you in.

if the doormans braincells are dead, then you can shout the password to him and he'll just blink blankly at you"

Biggest issue I'm facing is to be able to access the session.user.\_id, so i can use the unique \_id for mongoDb queries

Next Auth's getSession() only works on the CLIENT side NOT server side. so the session data can't be used to talk to mongoDB ☹️ unless I say AWAIT getSession()

I currently save the current user's id in localStorage but this is ALSO only client side (and security wise, isn't a good option)

Thought over my options, and the best choice seems to be to use contextAPI and getSession (store user id so it can be used throughout the app)

so when the user logins in, I'll have it set up so that it saves the current user's Id in the context (storage for global state objects)

When they sign out, it'll be removed from context

So far I know:

1. Context object STORES the shared data
2. Provider DELIVERS the context object when requested

Creating the actual context itself seems dead simple! 🥳

But I can feel my brain go numb whenever I try to figure out how to write the provider bit 🥴

huh seems I misunderstood the context API. Seems you have to declare the prop when you wrap something in <context.provider> . And my \_app.js page doesn't have access to session, only its children... so I can't place session in the context store?

Yeah as I figured, I can't access useSession in \_app.js, since \_app.js can't be wrapped in a <SessionProvider session={session}> 😭 Still tried anyway for the wild thrill of trying impossible things haha

But confirmed that I got context to work with a normal string `:)`

Was getting this error that what rendered was different than what the server had initially rendered

realized it was because the tagList from the fetch only was grabbed AFTER the server had rendered the page.

Once I told it to wait, no more error messages ~

Thanks to @rawandfaraidun (https://twitter.com/rawandfaraidun) I managed to fix my [...nextauth].js file so the session object will have the user's profile image link!

Made it so if a user goes to the dashboard when not logged in, they'll be automatically redirected to the login page.

useRouter() is a bit of an odd one, it doesn't work unless I stuff it in a useEffect, because it only works on client side.

I'm going to have the user's name and profile image load in ServerSideProps, so theres no delay.

However components can't use ServerSideProps, so I'll need to pass them as props to the layout from EACH page that calls it ...

Success is mine!! I got my onclick function to run two functions. AND the second one correctly grabs the first one data!

Here i was thinking I had to do .then(), ect, when just doing this works:

![alt text](FnDf5qvaAAIqXRf.png)

nevermind, once I json.Stringified the object i realized it was coming back as empty. So the second function isn't waiting on the first to finish :(

makes sense, as this isn't a proper callback but hoped it'd be this easy. Oh well!

Figured it out. So in the function that creates the new post, I had it await for cloudinarys message to return so we got the url for the image from cloudinary, and then it continues the rest of the function

![alt text](FnD3V97aUAIHkZL.png)

when I'm not wiped I'll work on making the actual api for sending the post request ect, but hey its still progress!

ngl i was stressing about how to make it /wait/ and for it to not freak out if the user didn't upload an image, didn't actually end up being too bad

nevermind I spoke too soon 🥲, looks like it ISN'T waiting to get data for that function to run. I have to click it twice for it to work
I'm using async await and then so i'm not sure why its not waiting for handleImageUpload() to finish running before the console.log goes off??

![alt text](FnD669yaAAUGdKQ.png)

Alright so I posted this in the 100devs discord but wanted to ask here juuuust in case someone can figure out what I'm doing wrong 🥲
is it maybe correctly waiting for the handleImageUpload function, but since state variables are async maybe the image variable hasn't updated?

only bug i'm noticing if that someone submits a post, it works fine the first time.

But the second time we get an error 🤔strange

figured it out! I had the description set to unique: true.

So I had to change it to unique: false and completely delete the original collection from mongoDB

Getting the newest posts to show up first was easier than I thought!

I just had to add a sort({\_id:-1})

I thought i'd have to use the timestamps but here they mentioned the ids could be used instead, so I did some digging and.... (1/2)

![alt text](FnUZrBuacAUYhkJ.png)

I found out why .sort({ \_id:-1}) worked to get the most recent documents!

Been working on my project in little bits of time but its been adding up!

1. Filtering now works
2. Edited my api so the newest posts show first
3. Each post has the users id. So EACH post COMPONENT calls an api, finds a user w/ that id & grabs the posters username and picture

hmm making the post's creation date show up correctly in the current users timezone is more complicated than I thought...

It looks like its not recommended to use the timestamps??
so i guess I'll have to add a dateCreated property. Then somehow convert it w/ luxon or something??

@JessePence5 @skadadark amused that both of my fav jesses came rushing to my aid to fight time itself, I can now confirm jesse is clearly the name of time lords! Thanks both for sharing the gems of your deep dives 🙏

Funnily enough I stumped across a simple solution

@58:00 he goes over managing the time https://youtube.com/watch?v=lyNetvEfvT0&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified

So i was able to take my timestamp from mongodb/mongoose and convert it to a date that will show in the users timezone!

Thanks again both of you, you're the best truly 💖

🤯This changes everything! https://youtube.com/watch?v=o7dZWGiXcA8&t=191s&ab_channel=HuzaifaAsif

Found out how to link two mongoDB collections and WOW, its SO much easier!

So now when I grab post data, and it automatically knows to look at the user collection and grab the data for that userID!🎉🎉🎉

me, wondering why an async function was being console.logged when it wasnt called???

So! turns out I forgot I had console.logged the variable earlier for something else, before reusing it for this function😂

FINALLY figured out how to get populate to work with an array of objectIds

Welp turns out that populate doesn't like it when some objects don't have any object ids for the field you want to populate 💀

so I either need to find a way to tell mongoose, hey if theres no object id in the path, do not populate. Or switch to apis for grabbing comments 😢

populate works fine when every post has comments though! So for now, I figured out the api logic for adding comments, and replies to comments ect, not letting replies nest too far ect ect

Progress! Instead of using ids, i let users look up profiles by unique profilenames

Made the grid layout change depending on screen size, so it doesn't get jumbled on small screens 🥴

Took a hot minute but figured out how to force a 404 if I get nothing back from the api! 😤

<video src="images/progress_instead_of_using_ids.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

For nextjs, the key was to return notFound: true if the .find() from the api returns [] (aka it found nothing)

![alt text](Fntyb8OaEAEgV91.png)

I also created the pages for individual posts! The likes feature ect also works here.

<video src="images/I_also_created_the_pages.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

Start of the dynamic page for individual names, also redirects to 404 is the name is not found

![alt text](Fnt5MpKagAEwP2R.jpg)

When findById() finds nothing the redirect to 404 works now, but required slightly different wording

Big thing left is the lost password function. users can already reset their password if they're logged in, but I'll have to somehow email them a link so they can edit it

guessing I'll end up using nodemailer & setting up nextjs email provider? But ugh, not looking forward to it

Worked on the front end bit of editing posts! Was dreading doing this and yeah it's taken hours 🥲

partly because I've never messed with modals before. But proud of my progress so far!

<video src="images/worked_on_the_front_end.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

What I"m especially proud of is the tags! They look simple but they kept appearing blank (aka text wasn't showing)
Was about to give up and make the user manually reenter the tags, when I realized this uses a label AND value tag!
The tags were showing up fine in react state,...

![alt text](Fnym1OUaQAAGFnN.png)
![alt text](FnynGViaEAEBEv4.png)
![alt text](Fnync1EakAEJ9hr.png)

So since they were appearing fine in the state, I knew there was something making the text not appear to the user.

So what I did was make sure the value showed the values AND tags by mapping through the tags and turning each one into an object with a tag and label. 🥳

Progress on the profile pages 🎊🎊🎊

Though I eventually need a different system than loading them in separate scrollable containers

maybe using a button and state, so when the button is clicked, the next 10 or so items are rendered? 🤔

🥴or maybe pagination...?

Still a good chunk left, but getting there!

Though I'll be working lots this week so RIP productivity 🥲
But! On the other hand, I was feeling the early signs of burnout so it's probably for the best I'm forced away from the computer

- pagination/endless scroll/ect?

- grabbing current numbers for dashboard "treat" points + profile page
- Show edit and delete symbol if signed in:  
   names
  comments

- Do edit and delete api logic for:
  posts, names, comments

-do descriptions section (frontend, backend/api, individual pages, adding to profile page + dashboard)

-fixing the header on some pages (adding session to it ect)

LATER

- followers + followers (will be shown on separate pages like on twitter)
- add tags to existing name
- add comments to names
- lost password feature
- shares

But with how insane my work schedule is, might have to push that to the "a future feature, not a mvp level feature list"

Worked more on my "100" hours project!

Users can now sign in with magic links through their email 🪄

Shame that for forgot passwords I can't just tell it, hey do this same exact thing, but redirect them to reset password page instead of the dashboard 🙃

![alt text](FoSMYfUakAAXgty.jpg)

Could just tell users in the email, hey if you want to reset your password go to your edit profile page after logging in with the magic link.

But alas that won't look as good as a direct link, curses 😂

I'm using next auth so the magic link setup is only for logins

I'd have to make a separate mongodb collection and write the logic myself for a lost pw magic link

But eh, I decided screw it. Users can use the magic link to login and go to edit profile to change their pw rn😂

Narrowing down what things have to "actually" be done to make the mvp version of the project

- Edit and deletion logic for names and comments
- adding descriptions category (frontend, backend/api, individual pages, adding to profile page + dashboard)
- grabbing actual numbers for "treat" points for dashboard and profile
- shares
  Possibly:
- followers and following
- add tags to existing names

Just thinking about writing out the reset password logic and page felt like death, so screw it 😂for now, users can just use the magic password link and manually go to the edit profile page to reset the password

> Janet! Sorry just one question but in your controllers on the server side, in your .create() does your object include a key for the image url and the cloudinaryId?

My Reply: For my app, I just stored the url in a variable because its all I needed.
But most people do end up using the public_id from my understanding.
You could have imagefromcloudinary store the entire data object, then take use the keys "url" and "public_id" to take out what you need

Was having a hell of a time updating my data for filtering names. Ex: Category: "Gender" Tags: Unisex, male, female.

So I wanted to split it into 2 collections, a category and a tags collection

So the category populate tags based on their objectID. But no matter how I tried

![alt text](Fo2SpCPaIAAYKvT.jpg)

mongodb REFUSED to work with the individual tags collection. Yet It worked with the user collection easily!
So created a new model and it works🤷‍♀️

maybe since I didn't use a plural name ("NameTag" not "NameTags")?

I had tried every casing w/ the old model so it shouldn't be that

![alt text](Fo2UQitaQAA3yOf.jpg)

Annnndd after killing and restarting the development server it now doesn't work 😂(smiling face with tears)

why are you like this???

Glad my paranoia paid off I i did this before posting this update on linkedin

It was working again when I briefly switched to the user model, then back to the NameTag model .... but once I killed and restarted the development server its returning {} when populate is run. Aka not working
WELP time to sleep. I'm now more confused than ever (smiling face with tears)

Posted this to the 100devs discord, hopefully someone will have an idea why mongoose's populate() is being so funky 🥴

"Hey everyone o/ happy valentines day! Speaking of valentines, I'll love you forever if you manage to help me solve this annoying mystery ;). Corny jokes aside, I've tried messing with mongoose's populate for hours but I'm having no luck. I'm trying to populate my namecategories collection's TAGS property, with TAGS from my tags collection.

However, it seems like something must be wrong with the tags collection, because populate works perfectly with my users collection, but returns an empty object when I use my tags collection???

Tried:

1. dropping collections for name categories and tags in mongodb and recreating them by creating new apis and new models, and submitting the new data to the api.

2. Dropping the tags collection and trying different names for the tags collection (NameTags, IndividualTags)

3. adjusting wording in the models, ect

Its so weird that it works perfectly with the users collection but it hates any version of the tags collection I've tried?"

![alt text](Fo8qgMDaMAAKTNJ.jpg)
![alt text](Fo8qjZ3aAAABcXK.jpg)
![alt text](Fo8ql8waAAUDcAk.jpg)

I could return to the old school route of manually typing the tags to the collection in mongodb.

Or create an api which submits a put request to the name categories collection to add tags

But this seems like the most professional solution? And its ALMOST working uggghhh

update in case someone stumbles across this thread later: https://twitter.com/Janetthedev/status/1626464366886518784 (unlikely with twitters algo but juuuust in case)

> REPLY (user deleted their account, but I was replying to something here)

Knew there was something I forgot to mention! I started out by using ref in my schema but it didn't work either.

So I ended up using this as an alternative, since it was easier to switch between the user and tag model for troubleshooting

Thanks though for the suggestion

1. Profile page: adding the descriptions the user has added to their profile page
2. Points system: adding the descriptions likes and added descriptions to the points system
3. Dashboard: adding liked descriptions to the dashboard

done! I suppose the next main things to focus on will be

1. making a single page for each description
2. sharing

Figured out how to push object ids into a documents comments array in mongodb!

buuut then I remembered that .populate will fail since some of my name documents arrays will be empty 🥲

So I have to scrap it, well learned something new anyway

![alt text](FpurSCWaAAAdCsJ.png)

So I'll end up doing the same workaround as I did for the posts page.

So the namelisting will call on an api to fetch all comments with that have its nameid, on rendering (thus the useEffect)

![alt text](Fpuuq7paIAAzkav.png)

sweet so the fetch in each component is working, now I just have to map through them and display them

![alt text](FpuxNaZakAET_KA.png)

Alright so now each one shows!

Phew that's enough for tonight. Later I'll just need to make it possible for users to reply to the comment for the name, like I did for posts, and it'll be done

![alt text](Fpu2An4aUAA6HD6.jpg)

> REPLY mattie.eth @EthMattie
> You should consider using a code formatter. There is a vscode extension called prettier which will format your code and give consistent style and spacing.

Thanks mattie! Its funny I've heard of prettier in passing but for some reason I thought it was more involved to implement? I was surprised how easy it looks to get set up

You've saved me a ton of time going through and cleaning up my code's formatting manually, thank you!

Update on my progress so far! If my job & the code is nice to me, with any luck I might release the 1st version in ~2 weeks!

After that, I'll probably wait until I've done most of the "future" features before sharing with the animal welfare community (maddie's pet forum ect)

Leftover Tasks

1. Finishing comment feature for names
2. Improve validation (description can include only so many letters, so no clowns can upload the bee movie script ect :P)
3. Checking if things are working, minor changes such as text sizes ect
4. Fix nav/clean up code
5. Move everything to a clean database
6. Host on render

FUTURE

1. SWR/pagination
2. add comments to descriptions
3. Notification feature
4. Advanced name search (begins with, contains, ends with)
5. Advanced description search (begins with, contains, ends with)
6. Advanced user search (begins with, contains, ends with)
7. Messaging feature, probably with socket io
8. Add inspiration section (users can share adoption listing examples they found or came up with, that they thought were cool)

Potential Future ideas:

1. Add giphy api/gifs support
2. Adoption campaign ideas section? It technically already exists in the community section but if it suprisingly becomes big enough, I could give it its own section
3. Add a "cookies" feature, where users can send virtual cookies as a special thank you. For example, if a user used a specific name they can send the user that created that description a cookie.
4. how to get involved and or/other tips. Example: explaining what goes on with fostering. Letting users find shelters with unique programs like doggydayout programs (can take specific shelter pets out in the community, to help them get adopted)
5. helpful sites/resources

Slept for a bit then:
🐸 added maxlength for various input fields, so users can't submit the bee movie script, ect :P
🐸 fixed the pages for viewing a single comment from posts, and a single comment from names
🐸users now can't submit descriptions if it already exists🥳

Thanks sephiroth for helping me test out some validation!

no army of sephiroth mimics in this database, there can only be one (sorry @ kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo)

🐊did some anki while picking up groceries
🐊worked on the project, buttons are now all in the BUTTON folder, ect. Sadly VSC is glitchy with updating the routes, so I had to manually update most of the paths, ugh
🐻keep falling asleep, body how about we not be a bear 😂?

getting close! What's left:

1. fix nav
2. clean up code (basically getting rid of console.logs)
3. move everything to a clean database
4. make sure things work
5. host on render

Prettiers pretty simple to set up but liked the little snippets he mentioned here https://youtube.com/watch?v=DqfQ4DPnRqI&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified

SO grateful for prettier, it would of been a nightmare to manually go through and clean up the formatting

switching to a new database was easy as I hoped! 😁
So now I'm making the official categories and tags. I tried to condense things into as few categories while also not adding too many tags to any one category

![alt text](FqSh60_acAEuxL4.jpg)

Ended up spoiling myself by creating a page just for me, where I can create a name tag, and then add it to several categories, that way I don't have to copy and paste ids manually!

still torn on whether to eventually allow for users to access this page, if they have very high levels of points and opt into it.

But eh, not expecting this site to go viral or anything so telling myself to put that off for maybe the future

🐢fixed share links so they no longer use localhost but instead grab the correct url from the env
🐢fixed next image issues
🐢improved filtering, so it doesn't flash at the user. Ended up being a dead simple fix that hit me as a random epiphany while showering
🐢changed headers!

Main pages have the same background image (thanks everyone who commented on the poll earlier for this!)

Pages for one specific item (ex: one name) I've decided to get rid of the header for

💫test everything to double check if everythings working, especially as a signed out user
💫 considering adding swr to the mvp, I was going to wait to implement it until later, but it really bugs me to not have this set up

Almost have swr to work but its being stubborn, I'm following the doc example but i'm confused why its loading all the names instead of just 10 at a time 😅ugggh so close!

Couldn't get it to work with a true infinite scroll (aka grabs 10 more pieces of data when you scroll down). But I've got it to work with a load more button and it plays nicely with my filtering, after lots of fine tuning! 🎊

Though now it doesn't automatically show new data 🙃

So I figured out I can revalidate/mutate the data when the user clicks, so they'll get any new data without having to refresh the page.

Although I'd be nice to automatically have new names pop up, I worry having mutate run constantly would be too resource intensive 🤔

Thinking about making it so users can personalize how many names ect they want to show on each page.

And they can give a page number, so they can jump back and forth through their filtered list 🤔

Been squeezing in tiny bits of code here and there, since i've been extra tired from getting that bread/working 😪

But I made some progress on pagination! I had to make it from scratch because of my apps filtering system & because I didn't want to overtax my free mongo account🎊

Ideally I would of liked to make a "real" pagination, where we know exactly how many items match the filters/know how many pages there are. Aka, filtered on mongodbs side before starting swr/grabbing the data in bunches.

But that would require users submitting a new mongodb request EVERY time they change their filters.
So instead, users will get the data from mongodb, and the page numbers will increase the further along they go, until the server tells us "I got nothing!". Filtering is done client side, to avoid extra requests

Going to move the pagination logic into a component, then add it to the bottom as well so the user won't have to scroll alllll the way back up

Then its time to add the pagination && swr to the description listings and community areas of the site
