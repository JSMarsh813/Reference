started off with a bang 🤣 did " npm run start" and was going what the hell why won't it show my edits unless I reboot it.

Realized I needed to do npm run dev 🤦‍♀️

was getting a "Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)" when importing a react component

Stared at my files for a second and realized I forgot to save the component's changes 🤡.

That immediate fix was instant serotonin!

I was trying to add links to the navbar in nextjs but I was getting this error:
"Error: Multiple children were passed to <Link> with `href` of..."

Found this tip about removing any space between <Link> and <a> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69667347/nextjs-multiple-children-were-passed-to-link-with-href-of-x-but-only-one/72754603

Fixed it! I would of NEVER of guessed 😂

Quotation from the stackOverflow Link: "Are you sure that's how its written in your source file? This error usually happens if you have a space in between <Link> and the <a> tags"

Couldn't resist trying to debug an axios error I kept getting: " OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite `test5` model once compiled"

Adding some code to the left of my exports helped it stop yelling about using the model again "mongoose.models['test5']" 🎊🎊

code snippet: "module.exports = mongoose.models['test5']|| mongoose.model("test5",CategoryCollectionSchema);

next step i suppose will be to store whats been clicked in a react state? and then send that to the server as a second get request. Oh boy, thats gonna take a while.

(an example: store christmas + male in state, and only get back animal names with both those tags)

Made some slow but definite progress!

I can generate a list from the server and also by clicking the checkbox i can store the selected results in an array in the state. And clicking even removes it from the array (after lots of struggle haha)!

Still trying to figure out how to make it so it'll let me narrow down/filter the search...
I want to start with all the names, and then have it look through the array of name objects (nameList here) and give me ones that have the given tags.

But thats for future me, Sleep time!

Ended up deciding to add a form to add new names 😄

I'm proud of my progress especially after working!

Users can select multiple tags (provided by a list from my server) and they can input a name. Both are saved in the state

Next step will be to have the button click = post request.

When setting up the post request I

1. Need to give them an error message if an existing name is there
2. have the objects from the state match the schema of the individualNames collection

its maddening since

2. if the incorrect login combo is given, they won't be redirected and the error messages work

sessions are the powerhouse of the applications braincells! basically

"but uh, imagine a website is a doorman where you have to say the right password to get into the club

so you say "let me into the pokemon club", the correct password (usually this is your email and password). The doorman's braincells are a session, he goes ah! You said the right password i'll let you in.

if the doormans braincells are dead, then you can shout the password to him and he'll just blink blankly at you"

Buuut when you're signed in, if you click a heart icon, it will change them ALL red 🤔

Biggest issue I'm facing is to be able to access the session.user.\_id, so i can use the unique \_id for mongoDb queries

Next Auth's getSession() only works on the CLIENT side NOT server side. so the session data can't be used to talk to mongoDB ☹️ unless I say AWAIT getSession()

I currently save the current user's id in localStorage but this is ALSO only client side (and security wise, isn't a good option)

Thought over my options, and the best choice seems to be to use contextAPI and getSession (store user id so it can be used throughout the app)

so when the user logins in, I'll have it set up so that it saves the current user's Id in the context (storage for global state objects)

When they sign out, it'll be removed from context

So far I know:

1. Context object STORES the shared data
2. Provider DELIVERS the context object when requested

Creating the actual context itself seems dead simple! 🥳

But I can feel my brain go numb whenever I try to figure out how to write the provider bit 🥴

huh seems I misunderstood the context API. Seems you have to declare the prop when you wrap something in <context.provider> . And my \_app.js page doesn't have access to session, only its children... so I can't place session in the context store?

Yeah as I figured, I can't access useSession in \_app.js, since \_app.js can't be wrapped in a <SessionProvider session={session}> 😭 Still tried anyway for the wild thrill of trying impossible things haha

But confirmed that I got context to work with a normal string `:)`

Was getting this error that what rendered was different than what the server had initially rendered

realized it was because the tagList from the fetch only was grabbed AFTER the server had rendered the page.

Once I told it to wait, no more error messages ~

(I was having problems but then remembered getSession() has to be used on pages not components, so I passed the session as a prop)

session({ session, user, token }) {

Made it so if a user goes to the dashboard when not logged in, they'll be automatically redirected to the login page.

useRouter() is a bit of an odd one, it doesn't work unless I stuff it in a useEffect, because it only works on client side.

I'm going to have the user's name and profile image load in ServerSideProps, so theres no delay.

However components can't use ServerSideProps, so I'll need to pass them as props to the layout from EACH page that calls it ...

Couldn't get it to work with a true infinite scroll (aka grabs 10 more pieces of data when you scroll down). But I've got it to work with a load more button and it plays nicely with my filtering, after lots of fine tuning! 🎊

Though now it doesn't automatically show new data 🙃

So I figured out I can revalidate/mutate the data when the user clicks, so they'll get any new data without having to refresh the page.

Although I'd be nice to automatically have new names pop up, I worry having mutate run constantly would be too resource intensive 🤔

If your mutate function is running too often, you could either throttle its execution, or debounce it!

This article is discusses functions that run on window resize, but you could definitely adapt the technique for your purposes!

Thinking about making it so users can personalize how many names ect they want to show on each page.

And they can give a page number, so they can jump back and forth through their filtered list 🤔

Been squeezing in tiny bits of code here and there, since i've been extra tired from getting that bread/working 😪

But I made some progress on pagination! I had to make it from scratch because of my apps filtering system & because I didn't want to overtax my free mongo account🎊

Ideally I would of liked to make a "real" pagination, where we know exactly how many items match the filters/know how many pages there are. Aka, filtered on mongodbs side before starting swr/grabbing the data in bunches.

But that would require users submitting a new mongodb request EVERY time they change their filters.
So instead, users will get the data from mongodb, and the page numbers will increase the further along they go, until the server tells us "I got nothing!". Filtering is done client side, to avoid extra requests

Going to move the pagination logic into a component, then add it to the bottom as well so the user won't have to scroll alllll the way back up

Then its time to add the pagination && swr to the description listings and community areas of the site
