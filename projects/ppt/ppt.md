started off with a bang 🤣 did " npm run start" and was going what the hell why won't it show my edits unless I reboot it.

Realized I needed to do npm run dev 🤦‍♀️

was getting a "Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)" when importing a react component

Stared at my files for a second and realized I forgot to save the component's changes 🤡.

That immediate fix was instant serotonin!

The UI adjustments/colors ect are for future me to figure out 😂

Although part of me wants to (FINALLY) start with the back-end, I know I'm too tired to work on it right now 😢

Time to nap 😴

I was trying to add links to the navbar in nextjs but I was getting this error:
"Error: Multiple children were passed to <Link> with `href` of..."

Found this tip about removing any space between <Link> and <a> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69667347/nextjs-multiple-children-were-passed-to-link-with-href-of-x-but-only-one/72754603

Fixed it! I would of NEVER of guessed 😂

Quotation from the stackOverflow Link: "Are you sure that's how its written in your source file? This error usually happens if you have a space in between <Link> and the <a> tags"
