> Janet! Sorry just one question but in your controllers on the server side, in your .create() does your object include a key for the image url and the cloudinaryId?

My Reply: For my app, I just stored the url in a variable because its all I needed.
But most people do end up using the public_id from my understanding.
You could have imagefromcloudinary store the entire data object, then take use the keys "url" and "public_id" to take out what you need

I finished adding the deletion option for names! And had a ü§Ø moment and realized I could easily turn it into a reusable component for all items.

I was having a hell of a time updating my data for filtering names. Ex: Category: "Gender" Tags: Unisex, male, female.

So I wanted to split it into 2 collections, a category and a tags collection

So the category populate tags based on their objectID. But no matter how I tried

![alt text](2023-02-13-mongodb-part1.jpg)

mongodb REFUSED to work with the individual tags collection. Yet It worked with the user collection easily!
So created a new model and it worksü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

maybe since I didn't use a plural name ("NameTag" not "NameTags")?

I had tried every casing w/ the old model so it shouldn't be that

![alt text](2023-02-13-mongodb-part2.jpg)

Annnndd after killing and restarting the development server it now doesn't work üòÇ(smiling face with tears)

why are you like this???

Glad my paranoia paid off I i did this before posting this update on linkedin

It was working again when I briefly switched to the user model, then back to the NameTag model .... but once I killed and restarted the development server its returning {} when populate is run. Aka not working
WELP time to sleep. I'm now more confused than ever (smiling face with tears)

Posted this to the 100devs discord, hopefully someone will have an idea why mongoose's populate() is being so funky ü•¥

> "Hey everyone o/ happy valentines day! Speaking of valentines, I'll love you forever if you manage to help me solve this annoying mystery ;). Corny jokes aside, I've tried messing with mongoose's populate for hours but I'm having no luck. I'm trying to populate my namecategories collection's TAGS property, with TAGS from my tags collection.

> However, it seems like something must be wrong with the tags collection, because populate works perfectly with my users collection, but returns an empty object when I use my tags collection???

> I Tried:

> 1.  dropping collections for name categories and tags in mongodb and recreating them by creating new apis and new models, and submitting the new data to the api.

> 2.  Dropping the tags collection and trying different names for the tags collection (NameTags, IndividualTags)

> 3.  adjusting wording in the models, ect

> Its so weird that it works perfectly with the users collection but it hates any version of the tags collection I've tried?"

![alt text](2023-02-14-100devs-mongodb-part-2.jpg)
![alt text](2023-02-14-100devs-mongodb-part-3.jpg)

I could return to the old school route of manually typing the tags to the collection in mongodb.

Or create an api which submits a put request to the name categories collection to add tags

But this seems like the most professional solution? And its ALMOST working uggghhh

update in case someone stumbles across this thread later: https://twitter.com/Janetthedev/status/1626464366886518784 (unlikely with twitters algo but juuuust in case)

> REPLY (user deleted their account, but I was replying to something here)

Knew there was something I forgot to mention! I started out by using ref in my schema but it didn't work either.

So I ended up using this as an alternative, since it was easier to switch between the user and tag model for troubleshooting

Thanks though for the suggestion

```
await category.find()
  .populate({path:"tags",
             model: "Tag"})
res.status(200).json(category)

```

welp time to review the to-do list again

![alt text](2023-02-18-fetch-descriptions-done.jpg)

fix erros from

1. nametag model ===> renaming nametag to tag

2. category model === name to category

-shares

possibly:

- followers and following

- add tags to existing names

- followers and follwing (will be shown on seperate pages like on twitter)

add comments to names

![alt text](delete-notes.png)

Okay so next I'll focus on

1. Profile page: adding the descriptions the user has added to their profile page
2. Points system: adding the descriptions likes and added descriptions to the points system
3. Dashboard: adding liked descriptions to the dashboard

done! I suppose the next main things to focus on will be

1. making a single page for each description
2. sharing

Huh letting users share links by clicking a button, which automatically copies the link to their clipboard is easier than I thought!

I already had the individual pages set up, so I just had to follow the instructions here!

https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/how-to-add-copy-to-clipboard-functionality-in-a-reactjs-app-45404413fdb2

<video src="images/2023-02-19-huh-letting-users-share-links.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

I still have to add a toastify popup that says its copied to clipboard.

And I want the share links section to pop up when the share button is clicked, but good progress for now!

```
{/ * SHARING OPTIONS SCREEN * /}

  <button
   onClick={()=>{
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(textForShare);

I figured out how to push object ids into a documents comments array in mongodb!

buuut then I remembered that .populate will fail since some of my name documents arrays will be empty ü•≤

So I have to scrap it, well learned something new anyway

```
import db from '../../../../utils/db'
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
import Name from "../../../../models/Names"

export default async function handler(req,res){
  const {method} = req;

  await db.connect();

  if (method ==="PUT"){
    console.log(`this is req body ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`)

  const {
    commentid,
    nameid
  } = req.body.commentIdToNameDoc

  try {
    const toUpdateName = await Name.findOneAndUpdate(
      {"_id":nameid},
       {$push: {comments: commentid}})
      console.log(toUpdateName)

    await toUpdateName.save();
    await db.disconnect();

    res.send({
      message: 'Comment added to name listing'
    });

  }
  catch(err){
     res.status(500).json(err)
     console.log(err)
  }
  }
}
```

![alt text](deeelllletecode.png)

So I'll end up doing the same workaround as I did for the posts page.

So the namelisting will call on an api to fetch all comments with that have its nameid, on rendering (thus the useEffect)

const handleFetchPosts = async () => {
const response = await fetch('http : / / localhost: 3000/api/individualbatsignalcomments/commentscontainingpostid/'+postId)

const data= await response.json()

console.log(data)

setPostsCommentsFromFetch(data)
}

useEffect(()=>{
handleFetchPosts();
})

![alt text](deletemoooorecode.png)

sweet so the fetch in each component is working, now I just have to map through them and display them

![alt text](2024-02-24-comments-part-1.png)

Alright so now each one shows!

Phew that's enough for tonight. Later I'll just need to make it possible for users to reply to the comment for the name, like I did for posts, and it'll be done

![alt text](2024-02-24-comments-part-2.png)

> REPLY mattie.eth @EthMattie

> You should consider using a code formatter. There is a vscode extension called prettier which will format your code and give consistent style and spacing.

Thanks mattie! Its funny I've heard of prettier in passing but for some reason I thought it was more involved to implement? I was surprised how easy it looks to get set up

You've saved me a ton of time going through and cleaning up my code's formatting manually, thank you!

Update on my progress so far! If my job & the code is nice to me, with any luck I might release the 1st version in ~2 weeks!

After that, I'll probably wait until I've done most of the "future" features before sharing with the animal welfare community (maddie's pet forum ect)

Leftover Tasks

1. Finishing comment feature for names

2. Improve validation (description can include only so many letters, so no clowns can upload the bee movie script ect :P)

3. Checking if things are working, minor changes such as text sizes ect

4. Fix nav/clean up code

5. Move everything to a clean database

6. Host on render

FUTURE

1. SWR/pagination

2. add comments to descriptions

3. Notification feature

4. Advanced name search (begins with, contains, ends with)

5. Advanced description search (begins with, contains, ends with)

6. Advanced user search (begins with, contains, ends with)

7. Messaging feature, probably with socket io

8. Add inspiration section (users can share adoption listing examples they found or came up with, that they thought were cool)

Potential Future ideas:

1. Add giphy api/gifs support

2. Adoption campaign ideas section? It technically already exists in the community section but if it suprisingly becomes big enough, I could give it its own section

3. Add a "cookies" feature, where users can send virtual cookies as a special thank you. For example, if a user used a specific name they can send the user that created that description a cookie.

4. how to get involved and or/other tips. Example: explaining what goes on with fostering. Letting users find shelters with unique programs like doggydayout programs (can take specific shelter pets out in the community, to help them get adopted)

5. helpful sites/resources

switching to a new database was easy as I hoped! üòÅ

So now I'm making the official categories and tags. I tried to condense things into as few categories while also not adding too many tags to any one category

![alt text](FqSh60_acAEuxL4.jpg)

I ended up spoiling myself by creating a page just for me, where I can create a name tag, and then add it to several categories, that way I don't have to copy and paste ids manually!

![alt text](FqSsqs2aYAABXj-.png)
![alt text](FqSsxCJaMAATCJd.png)

I'm still torn on whether to eventually allow for users to access this page, if they have very high levels of points and opt into it.

But eh, I'm not expecting this site to go viral or anything so telling myself to put that off for maybe the future

or it was working, went i went back to it again, the profile page flashes and then that error message appears (smiling face with a tear)üòÇ

even though getServerSideProps is working fine on other pages, I have a feeling this is because I was naughty and basically calling the internal api üôà

Tomorrow I'll copy over the parts of the api i need, like the documentation says to, and see if it likes that better

Slowly but surely making progress on debugging my next.js app!ü´†
Moved the api logic into the getServerSideProps and oddly, I have to use JSON.Parse(JSON.Stringify()) to get the prop to pass correctly

Thanks Joe for taking the time to offer some help!

My bad I should of clarified the bit of the question I was looking at was for the returned props, not the console.log. I need to use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for it to be passed correctly, otherwise I get a client error.

üê∏Moved most of the api logic into getserverside props
üê∏ managed to replace most imgs with Next Image...and now i understand why so many people hate next image (for 12 not 13) üò≠

Need to:
üí´fix a few errors
üí´change the related name input for descriptions, so the user can enter any names rather than selecting from existing names. It works for now, but grabbing a list of EVERY name would be unweildly eventually

Hoping to borrow some of your big brains!

For the headers do you think it'd be better to

1. keep the repeating images
2. replace all header images with the one used in the dashboard
3. leave it blank
   ü§î

Keep the repeating image (0%)
use the dashboard image (72.7%)

Couldn't get it to work with a true infinite scroll (aka grabs 10 more pieces of data when you scroll down). But I've got it to work with a load more button and it plays nicely with my filtering, after lots of fine tuning! üéä

Though now it doesn't automatically show new data üôÉ

So I figured out I can revalidate/mutate the data when the user clicks, so they'll get any new data without having to refresh the page.

Although I'd be nice to automatically have new names pop up, I worry having mutate run constantly would be too resource intensive ü§î

Thinking about making it so users can personalize how many names ect they want to show on each page.

Been squeezing in tiny bits of code here and there, since i've been extra tired from getting that bread/working üò™

But I made some progress on pagination! I had to make it from scratch because of my apps filtering system & because I didn't want to overtax my free mongo accountüéä

<video src="images/been_squeezing_in_tiny.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

Ideally I would of liked to make a "real" pagination, where we know exactly how many items match the filters/know how many pages there are. Aka, filtered on mongodbs side before starting swr/grabbing the data in bunches.

But that would require users submitting a new mongodb request EVERY time they change their filters.
So instead, users will get the data from mongodb, and the page numbers will increase the further along they go, until the server tells us "I got nothing!". Filtering is done client side, to avoid extra requests

Going to move the pagination logic into a component, then add it to the bottom as well so the user won't have to scroll alllll the way back up

Then its time to add the pagination && swr to the description listings and community areas of the site

Alas! Figures deployment wouldn't go without some hitches ü•≤ not sure why its giving me 500 when it works perfectly in the dev build?

and its showing me the message that pops up when the swr api file has been found...so its managed to get inside the right file?

<video src="images/alas_figures_deployment.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

this is such a weird error to me... running the dev and build locally work fine? But when deployed, i'll see all the data load and then woosh, theres 500 and client side errors?

![alt text](Fr7InLpaUAAUoRO.png)

the error isn't with swr infinite, since the error returned undefined.

Mongodb access is for all IPs (0.00 ect). Also its accessing the correct api file, since it shows the console.log at the start of the doc

not sure why the deployed version keeps getting 500 errors?? ü•¥

removed everything besides logging the various forms of the data

sadly sorting by likes/popularity looks like it'd be more complicated than just comparing the likedby property lengths, so alas maybe one day.

Swr complicates things sadly `:(`
I get chunks of data at a time (because of swr) so it would have to be sorted on mongodb's end so i'm grabbing the most popular posts firsts.

surprisingly aggregation wasn't too difficult despite lots of troubleshooting.

Found out the hard way you can't pass an object to sort like this =>
let sortObject = {"\_id": -1}
{ $sort: sortObject },

Instead you have to:
let sortObject= {};
sortObject["_id"] = -1ü•¥

Wild how much a few seconds (milliseconds) can change

Although my names page worked locally, when deployed to vercel I kept getting 504 errors (took too long for the api respond)
SO! I found out the hobby plan vercel will give up and send a 504 if your api is taking too long

So I ended up changing some logic around, and it now FINALLY works on vercel ü•≥

Sorting value and property was split on the client side, before being sent to the api

parseInt was added within the aggregation

It was a journey of many, many small steps forwards and back. But! victory is mine!üò§

I ended up being an overachiever again (suprise suprise). And I really, really wanted to figure out how to personalize the magic login link with next auth & add an image to the email

<video src="images/it_was_a_journey.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

path.join(process.cwd()) was especially a lil' fun bug to figure out and squish!
I figured out process.cwd but vercel also required path.join() to work
three cheers for googling skills && gratitude for those many helpful threads

https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-props#reading-files-use-processcwd
https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-files-in-serverless-functions

One thing that was a bummer is I was hoping to make two buttons

Button 1. signs user in and sends them to dashboard
Button 2. signs user in and redirects to the settings page

seems that next auth only likes one callback for magic links though?

Thought of a workaround but its unweildly and ehh, i really need to get other stuff done üòÇ

Could of added a Boolean "wantsToResetPassword" property to the user objects in mongo. When the user clicks the forgot password button, it would send a put request.

when the magic link spits them out @ login.Then look at session.user.resetPassword...if false ==> redirect to dashboard. if true, send to settings

When the user goes to the settings page, check if session.user.resetPassword is true. If it is send a put request to change it to false

so. it'd be a lot of tedious code, AND I feel like it should be possible to do this more simply. So in the end I'd be tossing out all that code anyway

but eh as cumbersome as it feels to tell them how to manually reset their password, it works for now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Even though your first instinct can be to look at the wonky element, usually its because another element later on is stubbornly demanding it be bigger than the screen width allows!

the problem child here was the filtering area demanding that it wanted to be 80px. Not perfect

![alt text](Fsh_AE4agAEQ_Sh.png)
![alt text](Fsh_jrraAAEoCQ9.png)

but close enough for my needs. Especially since that sliver only shows on super small mobile screens

I made it so the pages where tags and categories can be submitted are currently only submittable for me (my user id)

sooooomething terrible happened on the register page üòÇ that image is supposed to be the size of a chicken not a t-rex!

So, I was getting a client side error sometimes on the community page.
But luckily I'm familiar with this tantrum! It was because these smaller apis still use populate, which needs the user model imported (its greyed out but trust me, its an extremely annoying bug with populate)

Huh weirdly though it works fine locally, the likes button is acting weird in builds

in builds, you can click the likes heart. but if you click a second you get this error. If you click a third time, it works like it should of on that second click?

Got rid of that and the likes button works with npm run build && vercel

Alright so I figured out what happened there! I was a goof and forgot to make it so profilenames are always lowercase! so when the url changed it to lowercase, it could never match the capitalization in the profilename! Should be fixed now üôèüôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

ah! Good idea about the redirect

Turns out next js has custom 500 & 404 pages, so I was able to create customized pages that still have a working nav bar, so users can easily escape the error messages!ü•≥

Alright my first experience of working around existing users!

I discovered a bug where the profile link was using the user's name, instead of profilenameü§¶

I added profilename to session, but users who have an old session don't have it, so their nav bar freaks out and fails. So

![alt text](FtRnnciagAAV4S6.png)

So i made it so the profile link only shows on the nav bar, if session.user.profilename exists! This way they can still logout if they have an old session

alright so the error logs I got earlier was basically this and the core issue between them seems to be the mongoserver timing out?

So I switched db files (I had 2 different db files, one simplier and one more complex, no real good reason for it haha). & added extra logic

nooo the errors still continue (occassionally) ü•≤ 1st one is strange one! since it says its connected but mongo doesn't see it?

I had originally grabbed that code from coding with bashir https://youtube.com/watch?v=3kYkEVIZNZY&t=6964s&ab_channel=CodingwithBasir
at 1:51:55. But the tutorial is 2 years old, so maybe the codes too old to work properly with the current mongodb ect? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
https://github.com/basir/next-amazona/blob/main/utils/db.js

I could try to use this example from vercel/next js https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-mongodb/lib/mongodb.ts but I liked how the other one would maintain the connection if one already existed. Versus remaking the connection a ton of times...

Yeah nope that didn't fix it ü•≤ didn't have high hopes but ugggh https://github.com/JSMarsh813/PetProfileTailor/blob/main/pages/api/auth/%5B...nextauth%5D.js Doubt next auth itself is the issues, especially since its an await inside an async ... and the db.connect in the utils file has catch blocks... ü•¥

once I wake up I guess my only choice at this point is to post in the 100devs discord and hope really hard that someone can point me in the right direction ü•≤

hoping its just my code syntax ect.

I really don't want to update any dependencies if I can avoid it, though maybe its just because my mongodb and/or next auth is slightly older ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

‚òÑÔ∏è Write a letter of rec for one of my buddies
‚òÑÔ∏è Make it so users can't register with the magic link
‚òÑÔ∏è Fight w/ any errors petprofiletailor is still throwing if any
‚òÑÔ∏èget back on the anki/banki saddle
‚òÑÔ∏è Some overdue down time w/ ff14 & friends

magic link is fixed! new users will be redirected to the registration page

only con is the registration page requires they add a password, so not ideal for users that will always be signing in with the magic link

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ènot important enough to focus on for now though

Okay looks like I have to create a sign in callback to make sure users can't sign up with the magic link

https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/1229

and if the email doesn't already exist in the database, send them to the registration page ü§î

this is the cutest typoüòÇ

now picturing people having to sing to sign in to their app üéµ software dev meets musical!

![alt text](FtksnLKaAAAxykH.png)

Alright so the docs are annoying since they ONLY show the properties of Oauth provider and only vaguely hint at one property of the email provider üôÑ

luckily i'm stubborn and figured out how to grab the error from the url to piece together the object https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#sign-in-callback

![alt text](Ftk6QNaaQAAXlMU.png)
![alt text](Ftk6D6JaIAADerc.png)

it works locally! Now to deploy and make sure its working on the build version/vercel too

Users who use the magic link will be redirected to the registration page if the email does not exist in the users collection yet ü•≥

<video src="images/it_works_locally.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

So theres 3 properties for the email provider:user, account and email

I need the email they enter, so I can ask my database if the user collection has a document with that email.

So I grabbed user. email . If it doesn't exist (null), they'll be punted to the registration page

<video src="images/got_home_from_work.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

Ended up being a bit interesting since iframes tend to flash white at first.

So I stored the onLoad property in the "loaded" state. And made it so the iframe and button only shows when the iframe is fully loaded

I finished the 1st version of my project Pet Profile Tailor (my "100" hours project for 100devs)! üéä https://lnkd.in/gFttmaxh

It empowers animal lovers to help adoption counselors create impactful, fun, and tailor-fitted adoption profiles!

I worked as an adoption counselor in animal shelters for ~5 years. Although pet profiles are vital to boost adoption rates, there's only so much creativity a person can have at the crack of dawn.

Coffee can only do so much üòõ So I was inspired to create this site!

<video src="images/I_worked_as_an_adoption.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>

After signing up, users can submit new names and descriptions,save favorites and follow other users.

Users can easily search and filter through community submitted names and descriptions.

New pet parents can also use it to brainstorm pet names for their new family member üòÅ

I just noticed this vid still had the likes number glitch üòÇ whoops! thats what I get for using an oldish file

> Hi Janet, I saw your 100 hour project -love it! I‚Äôd never thought that the adoption counsellors have to make up new names and stories etc for all of the animals! I made a cat name/cat backstory generator at the weekend using OpenAI:

!!! So cool to see someone use chatGPT for this! I've been playing around with using chatGPT as a little section to my site so this gives me hope it won't be pain itself to setup

CatPastLives cracks me up, super cute & unique feature üòÇ

Also may I say, your UI is gorgeous üëåüî•

## NEW POSTS

I ended up deciding to cut √°√©√≠√≥√∫√±√º out as acceptable characters for name submissions since I'm not 100% sure if all shelter databases can support that input

(paranoia born of a horror story of when I was an adoption counselor and some invalid input shut down the db for a bit üòÖ)

However I want to do an invalid input check on the server side & client side

so i decided to pull out that function and put it in utils instead, so both files can easily import it

I tried using another utils file as a reference

```
utils\error.js

const getError = (err) =>
  err.response && err.response.data && err.response.data.message
    ? err.response.data.message
    : err.message;

export { getError };
```

```
Utils\stringManipulation\check-for-valid-names.tsx

const regexInvalidInput = (stringToCheck: string) => {
  let regexForInvalidCharacters = /[^a-z\d&'-]+/;
  return stringToCheck.match(regexForInvalidCharacters);
}

export default regexInvalidInput;

export {regexInvalidInput}

```

but then I got an error code

> Unhandled RunTime Error

> TypeError: >\_utils_stringManipulation_check_for_valid_names_WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8\_\_["default"] is not a function

I found this reference on mdn
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_a_function#import_the_exported_module_correctly

and the new version I made based on it works great

```
function regexInvalidInput(stringToCheck: string) {
  let regexForInvalidCharacters = /[^a-z\d&'-]+/;
  return stringToCheck.match(regexForInvalidCharacters);
}

/ / only strings not matching the a-z digits &'- will be returned
/ / aka if anything is returned, there was invalid input
export default regexInvalidInput;
```

```

    if (existingNameCheck && existingNameCheck.length != 0) {
      res.status(409).json({
        message: "Name already exists",
        existingName: existingNameCheck,
      });
    } else if (checkForInvalidInput.length) {
      res.status(409).json({
        message: `Invalid characters entered ${checkForInvalidInput}`,
      });
      return; <=== only one return
    } else
    ....
```

confirmed its still working client side!

But i'll have to temporarily turn off the check client side to make sure the server check is working

<img src="./images/2024-12-29-is-not-a-valid-characteri.jpg" alt="error message saying √°√≥ is not a valid character"/>

hmm okay the server check isn't working lets see what else i need to put

I noticed I accidentally put the statements in the same bracket lets separate them, Which lead to an error as we wanted!

Alas, its not the right error though, it should be that the name has invalid characters, not that it already exists ü§î

then i noticed i only have one return, but it turns out that wasn't the issue

<img src="./images/2024-12-29-success-message.jpg" alt="message saying the name was successfully added"/>

```
    if (existingNameCheck && existingNameCheck.length != 0) {
      res.status(409).json({
        message: "Name already exists",
        existingName: existingNameCheck,
      });
   else if (checkForInvalidInput.length) {
      res.status(409).json({
        message: `Invalid characters entered ${checkForInvalidInput}`,
      });
      return; <=== only one return
    } <===bracket from original if

     else {
      try {
        const test = await Names.create(req.body);
        ....}}
```

<img src="2024-12-29-name-already-exists-error.jpg" alt="getting the error that the name already exists"/>

then I looked an realized, wait, i set them both as having a status of 409

and my client side code is just looking at what the error code was to render the error message

```
Client side addingName.jsx

if (error.response.status == 409) {
          toast.error(
            `Ruh Roh! The name ${newName} already exists!`)
```

Changed the new eror message to 400 and ta-da it works!

```
    } else if (checkForInvalidInput.length) {
      res.status(400).json({ <=======changed from 409 to 400
        message: `Invalid characters entered ${checkForInvalidInput}`,
      });
      return;
    }
```

<img src="" alt="error pop up that says Ruh Roh! √°√≥ not added. An error has occured. Status code 400"/>

I was pretty sure what i needed was error.response.data.message but i started w/ stringify-ing error.response to be sure

and yep, thats what i needed!

Fixed up the toast errors so they grab the servers message

(so I'm using error.response.data.message instead of retyping "name does not exist" ect)

```
  } else if (error.response.status == 400) {
          toast.error(
            `Ruh Roh! The name ${newName} has invalid characters ${JSON.stringify(
              error.response,
            )}`,
          );
          ...}


```

> Ruh Roh! The name √°√≥ has invalid characters {"data":{"message":"Invalid characters entered √°√≥"},"status":400,.....}

```
 if (error.response.status == 409) {
          toast.error(
            `Ruh Roh! The name ${newName} ${error.response.data.message}!`,
          );
        } else if (error.response.status == 400) {
          toast.error(
            `Ruh Roh! The name ${newName} has ${error.response.data.message}`,
          );
        } else
        .....
```

I wanted to confirm the original error message (name already exists)

still is properly working. And turns out it is üòÅ

![error message shows with the text ruh roh! the name honda already exists](2024-12-29-original-error-message-still-works.jpg)

I cleaned things up so the server creates the error messages

and the client side code is just reading back the error response message created on the server

```
server side

 if (existingNameCheck && existingNameCheck.length != 0) {
      res.status(409).json({
        message: `Ruh Roh! The name ${name} already exists`,
        existingName: existingNameCheck,
      });
      return;
    } else if (checkForInvalidInput.length) {
      res.status(400).json({
        message: `Ruh Roh! The name ${name} has invalid character(s) ${checkForInvalidInput}`,
      });
      return;
    }
```

```
client side

  if (error.response.status == 409) {
          toast.error(`${error.response.data.message}!`);
    } else if (error.response.status == 400) {
          toast.error(`${error.response.data.message}`);
    }

```

as for why one has an error of 400 and the other is 409:

409 fits a name already existing (conflicts arising from the current state of the resource)

400 fits the name having invalid syntax ( points to issues with the request's syntax or structure)

I un-commented out the client side checks for invalid characters

annnnd we're done with validating the entered text for new names üòÅ
