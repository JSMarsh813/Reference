# Continuing the Database Connection Error Fight and Dealing with Edge Cases

Alright so I'm pretty sure the server problem is in here https://github.com/JSMarsh813/PetProfileTailor/blob/main/utils/db.js

But its frustrating that it very, very rarely occurs for me! I wish it was easier to test for ü•≤

with any luck this tiny line on 28 I added will of fixed it, but I doubt it

The error message:

I had originally grabbed that code from coding with bashir https://youtube.com/watch?v=3kYkEVIZNZY&t=6964s&ab_channel=CodingwithBasir
at 1:51:55.

But the tutorial is 2 years old, so maybe the codes too old to work properly with the current mongodb ect? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
https://github.com/basir/next-amazona/blob/main/utils/db.js

I could try to use this example from vercel/next js https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-mongodb/lib/mongodb.ts but I liked how the other one would maintain the connection if one already existed. Versus remaking the connection a ton of times...

---

Yeah nope that didn't fix it

I didn't have high hopes but ugggh https://github.com/JSMarsh813/PetProfileTailor/blob/main/pages/api/auth/%5B...nextauth%5D.js

I doubt next auth itself is the issues, especially since its an await inside an async ... and the db.connect in the utils file has catch blocks... ü•¥

![showing error log from vercel for api/auth/session](2023-04-12-error.jpg)

once I wake up I guess my only choice at this point is to post in the 100devs discord and hope really hard that someone can point me in the right direction

I'm hoping its just my code syntax ect

I really don't want to update any dependencies if I can avoid it, though maybe its just because my mongodb and/or next auth is slightly older ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Its frustrating since it seems most people fixed this issue by making it so all IPs are allowed, but my database is already set up to allow all IPS üôÉ

![showing that my ip address is set up to 0.0.0.0/0](2023-04-12-network-access.png)

Its not my config/env since it usually DOES work?

WELP for better or worse I installed the newest versions of mongodb and mongoose. So far nothings on fire so it didn't seem to do any harm at least ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

"dotenv": "^16.0.3"

Plans for today üöÄ

‚òÑÔ∏è Write a letter of rec for one of my buddies

‚òÑÔ∏è Make it so users can't register with the magic link

‚òÑÔ∏è Fight w/ any errors petprofiletailor is still throwing if any

‚òÑÔ∏èget back on the anki/banki saddle

‚òÑÔ∏è Some overdue down time with ff14 & friends

magic link is fixed! new users will be redirected to the registration page

only con is the registration page requires they add a password, so not ideal for users that will always be signing in with the magic link

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ènot important enough to focus on for now though

Okay looks like I have to create a sign in callback to make sure users can't sign up with the magic link

https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/1229

and if the email doesn't already exist in the database, send them to the registration page ü§î

this is the cutest typoüòÇ

![screenshot of a conversation that has a typo. the text says thanks i completely forgot about the sing in callback. this should be sign in not sign in](2023-04-12-sing-in-callback.png)

now I'm picturing people having to sing to sign in to their app üéµ software dev meets musical!

---

Alright so the docs are annoying since they ONLY show the properties of Oauth provider and only vaguely hint at one property of the email provider üôÑ

luckily i'm stubborn and figured out how to grab the error from the url to piece together the object https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#sign-in-callback

```
{"user":
    {"id": "fakeemail@gmail.com",
    "email":"fakeemails@gmail.com",
    "emailVerified":null},
"account":
    {"providerAccountId":"fakeemail@gmail.com",
    "userId:"fakeemail@gmail.com",
    "type":"email",
    "provider":"email"},
"email":
    {"verificationRequest":true}
}
```

![showing the highlighted url I grabbed the object that i decoded above this](2023-04-12-auth-error-message.png)

it works locally! Now to deploy and make sure its working on the build version/vercel too

---

Users who use the magic link will be redirected to the registration page if the email does not exist in the users collection yet ü•≥

<video alt="showing users that try to sign in with a magic link without registering, being redirected to the registration page if the email does not exist in the database yet" src="images/2023-04-12-it-works-locally.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls></video>

So theres 3 properties for the email provider: user, account and email

```
{"user":
    {"id": "fakeemail@gmail.com",
    "email":"fakeemails@gmail.com",
    "emailVerified":null},
"account":
    {"providerAccountId":"fakeemail@gmail.com",
    "userId:"fakeemail@gmail.com",
    "type":"email",
    "provider":"email"},
"email":
    {"verificationRequest":true}
}
```

I need the email they enter, so I can ask my database if the user collection has a document with that email.

So I grabbed user. email . If it doesn't exist (null), they'll be punted to the registration page

```
callbacks: {
    async signIn({user, account, email}){
        console.log(JSON.stringify(user.email));
        await db.connect();
        const userExists = await User.findOne({
            email: user.email,
        });
        console.log(userExists);
        if (userExists){
            return true;
        } else {
            return "/regiser";
        }
    },
    .....
}
```

sweet the fix also works on the deployed version ü•≥

Got home from work and did a bit of project work.

Guess what, those three buttons on the landing page have finally found their lifes purpose! ü•≥

Thanks @alexisintech for reminding me! I had half-forgotten about finding a job for those buttons

<video alt="when the buttons are clicking different iframes appear of different animal related videos" src=images/2023-04-16-got-home-from-work.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls></video>

It ended up being a bit interesting since iframes tend to flash white at first.

So I stored the onLoad property in the "loaded" state. And made it so the iframe and button only shows when the iframe is fully loaded

On vercel it still shows a brief flashü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

better than it was though

```
...
const [loaded, setLoaded]= useState(false);

return (
    <div ....>
        {!loaded && <span className="text-white text-xl"> Loading ... </span>}

    <GeneralButton
      text="close X"
      className={`...... ${ loaded? "block":"hidden"}`}
      ........../>

    <iframe
        className={`mx-auto aspect-video w-11/12 lg:w-7/12 ${styling} ${
            loaded? "block" : "hidden"
        }`}
        width="mx-auto"
        scr={`https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/${embedId}`}
        title={`${title}`}
        allow="web-share"
        onLoad={()=>setLoaded(true)} <====== highlighted code
        allowFullScreen
        ></iframe>
    </div>
)
```

also I'm still SO in love with modules/react!

It was so satisfying to set up allll the embedding logic in a component, so the index page has the minimal needed information üòä

```
{ImpactfulClicked && (
    <div className="relative">
        <YouTubeEmbed
            embedId="y4randomnumbers">
            styling="aspect-video"
            title="fishtopher the cat gets adopted after going viral"
            showVideoFunction={()=>updateImpactfulState()}
            key="y4randomnumbers"/>
    </div>
)}

{funClicked && (
    <div className="relative">
        <YouTubeEmbed
            embedId="k4randomnumbers">
            styling="aspect-video"
            title="Woman writes hilariously honest adoption post for her wild foster dog | The Dodo Adopt me!"
            showVideoFunction={()=>updateFunState()}
            key="k4randomnumbers"/>
    </div>
)}

{tailorClicked && (
    <div className="relative">
        <YouTubeEmbed
            embedId="a4randomnumbers"">
            styling="aspect-video"
            title="Woman's brutally honest pet adoption ad goes Viral"
            showVideoFunction={()=>updateTailorState()}
            key="a4randomnumbers""/>
    </div>
)}
```

stackoverflow.com/questions/71159356/nextauth-throwing-client-fetch-error-error-in-session-callback

Found this little tidbit and crossings fingers this will cure the randomly occuring next auth 500 errors!

Basically, I realized jwt and session weren't async and I added extra if statements

![added async to jwt and session](2023-04-16-differences.png)

![next auth client fetch error unexpected character at line 1 colum 1 of the json data](2023-04-16-error.png)

![vercel log for /api/auth/session error ](2023-04-16-vercel-error.jpg)

so far logging in still works, so it seems like those additions didn't break everything at least!

Promising so far but I'm wary to get my hopes up

I finished the 1st version of my project Pet Profile Tailor (my "100" hours project for 100devs)! üéä https://lnkd.in/gFttmaxh

It empowers animal lovers to help adoption counselors create impactful, fun, and tailor-fitted adoption profiles!
code: https://lnkd.in/gizc8zPV #100devs

<video alt="video clicking through the site" src="images/2023-04-21-I-finished-the-1st.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls></video>

I worked as an adoption counselor in animal shelters for ~5 years. Although pet profiles are vital to boost adoption rates, there's only so much creativity a person can have at the crack of dawn.

Coffee can only do so much üòõ So I was inspired to create this site!

<video alt="clicking through more site features" src="images/2023-04-21-I-worked-as-an-adoption.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls></video>

After signing up, users can submit new names and descriptions, save favorites and follow other users.

Users can easily search and filter through community submitted names and descriptions.

New pet parents can also use it to brainstorm pet names for their new family member üòÅ

I just noticed this vid still had the likes number glitch üòÇ whoops! thats what I get for using an oldish file
